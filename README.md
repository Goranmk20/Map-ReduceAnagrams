Map-ReduceAnagrams
==================

This is basic implementation for finding anagrams in map-reduce programming model. It's implemented in Hadoop File System.
To work properly you must provide two arguments: 
            1) The path of the input file (words in english)
            2) The path of output file (anagrams of the words)
